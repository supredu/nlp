The juggernaut economy grew an annualised 11.3 per cent in the second quarter, the fastest pace since 1995 and well ahead of consensus forecasts. @ Clearly, the various tightening measures implemented throughout the quarter have had a limited impact. Money is still cheap and plentiful, buoyed by a bloated trade surplus, so spending continues apace – not all of it productive.
